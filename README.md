# Spatiotemporal analysis of F-actin polymerization with micropillar arrays reveals synchronization between adhesion sites

This project is based on the article [Spatiotemporal analysis of F-actin polymerization with micropillar arrays reveals synchronization between adhesion sites](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.22.600020). The study repurposed micropillar-arrays to quantify spatiotemporal inter-adhesion communication. Following the observation that integrin adhesions formed around pillar tops we relied on the precise repetitive spatial control of the pillars to reliably monitor F-actin dynamics in mouse embryonic fibroblasts as a model for spatiotemporal adhesion-related intracellular signaling.
